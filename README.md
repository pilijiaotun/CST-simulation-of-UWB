# CST-simulation-of-UWB
The communication performance of the system is determined by the ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna which is the core component of the UWB communication system. The UWB antennas are widely used in communication systems, as it has the advantages such as low profile, low power consumption and flexible integration. However, a lot of WLAN(5.15~5.825 Ghz) devices are used in our daily life, so this report aim to find a way to decrease the spectrum interference of WLAN. After learning and searching, I initially thought of using stopband to adjust the working frequency of UWB to cover 3.1 ~ 10.6GHz, but it shows stopband characteristics in WLAN frequency band. This paper combined with these characteristics of UWB system, and try to get a better performance of the antenna by using CST.
This project is trying to finish the simulation of from a project of Beijing University..
